Introduction
============

'memtrace' is a software to measure the memory usage of a piece of
software. The software is run with 'strace' to find all the system
calls made and the memory usage is computed from the calls that deal
with memory allocation (in Linux those are 'brk', 'mmap', 'mremap',
'munmap'). The 'clone' system call is also checked to handle properly
multi-threaded applications.

This software is most likely Linux specific at this point.

Installation
============

'memtrace' is a one-file ruby script, so Ruby must be
installed. Simply copy 'memtrace' somewhere in your path and make it
executable. For example:

$ cp memtrace ~/bin
$ chmod a+x ~/bin/memtrace

Usage
=====

The simplest way is to prepend your command with 'memtrace'. The
command will be run normally and when done, the maximum memory usage
is printed to stderr (similarly to the way 'time' works). For example:

$ memtrace ls >/dev/null
       max: heap     135168   (132k) mmap     136168   (133k) vm     271336   (265k)

The redirection of stdout (i.e. >/dev/null) discards the output of
'ls' and only the output of 'memtrace' is shown.

By default, only the memory page which have write access are
counted. The pages used by the code of the shared library are not
counted. In other words, what is reported is only the memory used by
the software to store things in memory.

To include all the pages, included the read only ones, use the '--all' switch:

$  memtrace --all ls >/dev/null
       max: heap     135168   (132k) mmap   18297680  (17.5M) vm   18432848  (17.6M)

The raw output of strace can be saved to a file to be examined by
'memtrace' later. For example:

$ memtrace -r trace ls >/dev/null
       max: heap     135168   (132k) mmap     136168   (133k) vm     271336   (265k)
$ memtrace -f trace
       max: heap     135168   (132k) mmap     136168   (133k) vm     271336   (265k)
$ memtrace -f --all trace
       max: heap     135168   (132k) mmap   18297680  (17.5M) vm   18432848  (17.6M)
